I thought this was fairly entertaining...

I wrote a simple [page hit counter](http://bag-o-code.appspot.com/counter/start
 "Page Hit Counter") for a couple Ebay / Craigslist listing we were doing (using
 Google's [AppEngine](http://appspot.com "AppEngine"), and Yahoo's
 [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ "Yahoo YUI")).

Recently I added a feature to allow it to graph visitor counts over time
 (basically a cheesy analytics engine).

I guess one of the items was particularly desirable (a very complete, good
 codition SNES system with a lot of games) because it had what I image is
 probably a pretty typical graph of visits to an Ebay auction:

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CeryDY5B7Rk/S1k3Gz-C2yI/AAAAAAAABmE/jiDFgKJJjFo/s1600-h/screen-capture.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 339px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CeryDY5B7Rk/S1k3Gz-C2yI/AAAAAAAABmE/jiDFgKJJjFo/s400/screen-capture.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429431415941028642" /></a> 

It's pretty obvious that the spike (a huge spike) in visitors is when the
 auction was about to close when everyone was manically hitting reload.  Just
 eyeballing the graph, it looks like an exponential increase.
