Visual Studio has a tool [ERRLOOK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/akay62ya.aspx "Visual Studio ERRLOOK Utility") which looks up explanations of error codes.  When you don't have the convenience of application code that automatically converts and reports this back to you it's nice to have.

I don't know of a similiar utility on Linux, but I know the library calls exist to write it (at least for well known system error codes).

Below is my first pass at writing this utility for Linux / Mac OS X using [Python's](http://python.org) [CTypes](http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html "CTypes Module").

The benifit of using python is that it doesn't need to be compiled (though this is a small benefit)-- it's also an example of using CTypes to do [FFI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface "Wikipedia Entry for Foreign function interface").

The calls to load `libc.dylib` or `libc.so.1` might need to be tweaked depending on the system it's running on.
